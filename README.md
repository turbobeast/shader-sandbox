## Shader Sandbox

Just messing with fragment shaders right now.

## Running Shaders

There are many solutions for this, but i like [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer). Once you have it installed, you are ready.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:turbobeast/shader-sandbox.git
cd shader-sandbox
glslViewer sun.frag.glsl
```
